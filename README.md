Top 15 sorting algorithms

Hey guys, im studying algorithms in this semestar of the year, so i thought it would be cool to have collection of sorting algorithms here.
As im learning about sorting algorithms and researching online for solutions how they works, i saw many of them but not so clean and easy understandable.
So, you will find here top 15 sorting algorithms implementation (generally in c#) all clean and easy to understand code.Idea originally came from 15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes on Youtube.

Algorithms:

1.Bubble sort
2.Selection sort
3.Insertion sort
4.Merge sort
5.Quick sort
6.Heap sort
7.Radix sort (LSD)
8.Radix sort (MSD)
9.Intro sort
10.Adaptive merge sort
11.Shell sort
12.Cocktail shaker sort
13.Gnome sort
14.Bitonic sort
15.Bogo sort
